This project demonstrates aspects of the cross site scripting attack in a tutorial fashion.

In order to run the project you must have `node` and `git` installed.

cd xss-project
```

npm install && npm start
```

The vulnerable site will run on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000) and the malicious site will run on [port 3001](http://localhost:3001).
