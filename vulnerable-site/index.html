                        <p>What is Cross Site Scripting? This project is focused on answering that question along with
                            providing some analysis on how to prevent these types of web based vulnerabilities. There
                            are two forms of cross site scripting (xss) attacks that this guide will cover,
                            <strong>reflected xss</strong>, and <strong>stored xss</strong>. <br><br>To demonstrate
                            these vulnerabilities I have created a vulnerable input in the right half of the screen that
                            simulates a form input one might find on a social media site or website forum comment
                            section. A malicious site is also running on <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://localhost:3001">localhost:3001</a> that will be collecting data taken
                            throughout the demonstration attacks.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Cross site scripting is a form of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into
                            webpages. An unsuspecting user can trigger these scripts and because the source web
                            application is trusted, the user's browser will execute the scripts and access sensitive
                            information stored in the user's browser. The two methods in which a cross site scripting
                            attacks can occur are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web
                                request.</li>
                            <li>The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being
                                validated for malicious content.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="is-size-5">Stored Cross Site Scripting</h6>
                        <p>Attacks can be delivered in a variety of ways, one of which is by permanently storing a
                            malicious script in a database or storage of a web application. This attack, also known as
                            persistent xss, is the most damaging of xss attacks as the malicious script is reused by the
                            trusted source application and returned to users in valid web requests.</p>
                        <p>A typical Stored attack proceeds as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The attacker visits the vulnerable website and injects the malicious code.</li>
                            <li>The malicious code is persisted on the server.</li>
                            <li>The user visits the vulnerable website and runs the malicious code.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="is-size-5">Reflected Cross Site Scripting</h6>
                        <p>Reflected cross site scripting attacks are where an injected script is reflected off of a web
                            server through unsuspected users. A user might click on a bad link in an email or on a
                            suspicious webpage and be redirected to a site that they trust. But little do they know that
                            the link they clicked also includes an embedded script that will take advantage of the
                            user's
                            previous interactions with the trusted site.</p>
                        <p>A typical Reflected attack proceeds as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The user visits the attacker's website (or receives an email, etc.) and clicks on a
                                link.</li>
                            <li>The user is redirected to the vulnerable website with the malicious code encoded in the
                                URL parameters.</li>
                            <li>The user unintentionally injects and runs the malicious code as an effect of visiting
                                the vulnerable website.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h1 class="is-size-4">Demonstration</h1><br>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Lets quickly go over how this demonstration works. The webpage you are currently on is
                            considered to be the vulnerable webpage, in which an attacker can inject malicious scripts
                            and a user can trigger those scripts. The malicious webpage, running on <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://localhost:3001">localhost:3001</a>, is where a user's data will be
                            sent once a malicious script has been executed on this webpage. <br><br>Both
                            webpages are running a node.js server and can be modified by changing the app.js files in
                            either the /vulnerable-site or /malicious-site directories. It is also worth mentioning that
                            you may have to refresh or reopen the malicious site after submitting attacks on this site
                            as
                            it won't dynamically update on it's own.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>First let's add a comment to the input form to see how the form acts with normal behavior.</p>
                        <div class="columns is-centered">
                            <div class="column is-two-thirds">
                                <figure class="image box">

                                </figure>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>The other change you might notice is the url now reads something like:</p>
                        <pre>http://localhost:3000/?comment=This+is+a+comment+on+an+online+forum%21</pre>
                        <p>As you can see from the url, the form submit sends a new comment request query to the server
                            along with the text from the comment. If you were to open another instance of <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://localhost:3000">the vulnerable site</a> in a different tab you would see your
                            comment persist as the server is storing the value of all comments. But what if instead of text,
                            an attacker were to send the server an executable script that became stored?</p>
                        <p>Lets now take on the role of an attacker, instead of entering a comment into the form try
                            entering this Javascript statement:</p>

                        <p>If you look at both the url and <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3001">the malicious site</a> you will see that your request was successful in
                            sending the url query data to the malicious site. Try opening <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://localhost:3000">the vulnerable site</a> in a new tab and typing a comment as an
                            unsuspecting user. After clicking submit, you should see that comment appear in the malicious
                            site as stolen information!</p>

                        <p>Perhaps you have begun to see the power of this attack. If a website caches some sensitive data
                            unique to the user, it is now possible for an attacker to manipulate users into sending them the
                            data without their knowledge.</p>
